/**
 * Abstract base class for all components within the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.
 *
 * Components are primarily intended to store data (state) associated with an entity.
 * They should generally avoid containing complex logic, which is better suited for Systems.
 *
 * Lifecycle hooks (`onAdd`, `onRemove`, `onUpdate` [optional]) can be implemented
 * to react to the component being added to, removed from, or updated on an entity
 * via the `EntityManager`.
 *
 * Subclasses **must** define their specific data properties in their constructor.
 * Subclasses **must** override the `serialize` method to return a plain JavaScript
 * object representing only the component's persistent state, suitable for saving
 * and loading scenes. Failure to override `serialize` will result in a runtime error log
 * and potentially incorrect scene saving/loading.
 *
